## 📖 About the Project

The Cypress Test Automation Project for Serverest aims to provide comprehensive test coverage for both the frontend and backend of the Serverest platform. It leverages Cypress's powerful testing capabilities to perform robust end-to-end tests and API requests tests, ensuring the platform's overall quality and performance.

### 🔍 Frontend E2E Testing

The front-end end-to-end tests focus on simulating user interactions and validating the behavior of the Serverest web application. These tests cover various scenarios, including:

- User Authentication
- Navigation
- CRUD Operations

### 🔍 API Requests Testing

The API tests focus on validating the functionality of the Serverest backend. These tests ensure that the API endpoints respond correctly to different requests, covering scenarios such as:

- Data Retrieval
- Data Creation
- Data Updating
- Data Deletion

## 🎯 Repository Purpose

This repository serves as a demonstration of my skills in test automation using Cypress. It includes a comprehensive set of test scripts for both frontend and API testing, showcasing my ability to create robust and maintainable test suites. This project is intended for learning purposes and to demonstrate my proficiency in using Cypress for end-to-end and API testing.
